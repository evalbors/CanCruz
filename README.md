### Summary

This was our first big project with Laravel! We had three weeks to create a full website for a hostal with a reservation system where the clients could create a reservation. There also had to be an admin dashboard where the owners would be able to view a list of reservations!

## Reservation System

It had no payment system. The idea was that the client would pay once he got to the Hostal.

#### There are two ways of starting a reservation:

-   Visiting the room page and reserving straight from there:

-   Clicking the reservation button and choosing a room from there:

One you had chosen the room and how many people would be staying you would be redirected to the second stage:

And once you had done that you would be shown the final page with all the information about your reservation you just made:
